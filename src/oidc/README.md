## Context
The `oidc` subdirectory contains most of the relevant code related to OGPass' role as an OpenID Provider.

This subdirectory is modeled loosely on the [example repo](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/tree/main/example) provided by the creator of the `oidc-provider` npm library (the associated GitHub repo is [`node-oidc-provider`](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider)).
